“THE HASKELL ROAD”
CHAPTER ONE
MY ANSWERS

Exercise 1.1. Try out a few calculations using * for multiplication, + for addition, - for subtraction, ^ for exponentiation, / for division. By playing with the system, find out what the precedence order is among these operators.

My answer:

Prelude> 2 ^ 4 * 6 + 8
104
Prelude> 2 ^ 4 * (6 + 8)
224
Prelude> 2 ^ (4 * 6) + 8
16777224
Prelude> (2 ^ 4) * 6 + 8
104
Prelude> ((2 ^ 4) * 6) + 8
104

Unsurprisingly, order of operations is exponentiation, multiplication, and addition.
